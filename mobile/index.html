			<h1>About the Couple</h1>
			<p>Brydon and Tabby met at Redeemer in 2011. They started off as classmates in English class and quickly became friends as they often saw each other in the library. Tabby worked as a part-time librarian and Brydon would, conveniently, go there to study during her shifts. </p>
			<p>A day after Tabby's 19<sup>th</sup> birthday, Brydon suggested they watch a movie on Dundas peak. Tabby agreed without hesitation. As they made their way to the cliff she began to doubt whether it might have been quite foolish to agree to this spontaneous trip. All she could think of was those stories your mother tells you about girls getting murdered in forests by strange men. Thankfully, this story instead took a rather joyous turn. Brydon turned out to be the man Tabby would be married to and not murdered by. As for strange men in forests, Brydon is still a strange man, however Tabby is a pretty strange woman and they still enjoy a good hike in a forest.</p>
			<p>Since that fateful November night, Brydon and Tabby have devoted themselves to growing in faith and growing in love for each other. They have learned many lessons together and are completely determined to fight for one another and, in all things, honouring God in the way they live their lives.</p>
